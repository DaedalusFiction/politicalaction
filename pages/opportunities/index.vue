            Activism requires everyone to take part, whether in big or small
            ways. Though it can be intimidating and challenging, it doesn't have
            to be so. Grab a buddy, volunteer. Or meet new friends through your
            advocacy work. Become a part of your local community. That's where
            our strength is.

            More than ever, it is crucial that government, the media, and
            grassroots organizations alike maintain as much data privacy of
            community members as possible. Techniques such as web scraping and
            artificial intelligence (AI) make it easier than ever to amass large
            amounts of information extremely quickly from the internet. Sharing
            or posting sensitive information can lead to irreparable harm. As
            the saying goes, 'Once on the internet, always on the internet.' As
            a result, we invite public, private, and volunteer organizations to
            take our Data Privacy and Reporting Guideline Pledge, especially
            when handling public health information (PHI) and personally
            identifiable information (PII). PHI is defined by the

            as “an individual's health, treatment, and payment information, and
            any further information maintained in the same designated record set
            that could identify the individual or be used with other information
            in the record set to identify the individual.” PII is defined as
            information that, when used alone or with other relevant data, can
            identify an individual.

            How the Data Privacy and Reporting Guidelines pledge applies to
            organizations depends on the type and scope of their organizational
            responsibilities. Please see some examples below:

                sensitive files encrypted.

                Police departments may take the data privacy pledge and omit any
                PHI of those who are missing when creating missing posters. The
                general public may not find this information helpful or
                understand specific diagnoses. Once a loved one is found, they
                may find that the diagnosis they worked hard to keep private is
                now known to their entire community.
